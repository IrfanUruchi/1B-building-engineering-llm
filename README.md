Fine-tuning EleutherAI/pythia-1b for building-engineering tasks using 4-bit quant + LoRA

> **A birthday gift for my dad**  
> Happy Birthday, Dad! I built this LLM assistant just for you‚Äîtuned on building‚Äêengineering knowledge

## üõ†Ô∏è What Is This?

This repository contains a fine‚Äêtuned version of the EleutherAI **pythia-1b-deduped** model, adapted specifically for building-engineering tasks:

- **4-bit Quantization** (via BitsAndBytes) to keep things lightweight  
- **LoRA Adapters** to learn domain knowledge without retraining the whole model  
- A small, clean training recipe so you (or anyone) can reproduce my steps

## Disclaimer 

This LLM is still in late fine tuning phase i have collected data for 4 months studied the Building engineering for months to know what is right and what is wrong because iam computer engineering the full LLM will be avaiable soon when my dad will have his birthday.
